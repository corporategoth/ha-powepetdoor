Timezone Setting
    - The timezone is set with SET_TIMEZONE function (and likely GET_TIMEZONE).  It's also reported on settings.
    - The timezone includes DST timings.  eg. EST5EDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0
    - Need to figure out how to set this up properly to be editable without screwing things up!

Scheduling Support
    - Schedule helpers are normally backed by a Store.  Right now, our schedule entity is not, meaning:
        1. When you click on the helper, you can't see or edit the schedule.  This is a flaw in the schedule
           component itself, as editing the schedule seems use websockets directly manipulating the store
           that then notify the schedule entity (as opposed to manipulating the entity and updating the store).
        2. We CAN'T access the same store as the schedule, as the schedule component hides the store it
           creates away in a function.  Meaning the store knows about schedule entities, but NOT the other
           way around, so I can't "attach" to the store, or embed the store-created entity in my entity.
        3. We can't use an alternative store (real or virtual), because the websockets API is bound to the
           store, so if we use a new store/API, it won't know how to present the edit components in the UI.
        4. Using the websockets API to create/edit the schedule (when the schedule is refreshed from the
           door) seems kludgy, and will leave behind the baggage of an old schedule helper if you deleted
           or renamed the door.
        5. A feature request to fix this has been requested here:
           https://community.home-assistant.io/t/new-schedule-entity-so-it-can-be-used-in-integrations/468072
           But with not many votes, it will likely never happen.
        6. A VERY simply PR that would make this possible, was rejected, so this basically will not happen:
           https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/106882
