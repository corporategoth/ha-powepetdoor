Timezone Setting
    - The timezone is set with SET_TIMEZONE function (and likely GET_TIMEZONE).  It's also reported on settings.
    - The timezone includes DST timings.  eg. EST5EDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0
    - Need to figure out how to set this up properly to be editable without screwing things up!

Scheduling Support
    - Scheduling is done using a series of schedule entities.
    - The list of entities is obtained with GET_SCHEDULE_LIST (returns an array of indexes)
        {"schedules":[0,1,2,3],"success":"true","msgID":425,"dir":"d2p","CMD":"GET_SCHEDULE_LIST"}
    - You can remove a schedule entry with DELETE_SCHEDULE (passing in the index)
    - Set or replace schedule entries with SET_SCHEDULE commands, looking like:
        {"config":"SET_SCHEDULE","index":0,"schedule":{"index":0,"inside":true,"outside":false,"in_end_time":{"hour":23,"min":59},"in_start_time":{"hour":0,"min":0},"out_end_time":{"hour":0,"min":0},"out_start_time":{"hour":0,"min":0},"enabled":true,"daysOfWeek":[0,1,1,1,1,1,1]},"msgId":426,"dir":"p2d"}
      Response:
        {"schedule":{"index":0,"daysOfWeek":[0,1,1,1,1,1,1],"enabled":1,"inside":1,"outside":0,"in_start_time":{"hour":0,"min":0},"in_end_time":{"hour":23,"min":59},"out_start_time":{"hour":0,"min":0},"out_end_time":{"hour":0,"min":0}},"success":"true","msgID":426,"dir":"d2p","CMD":"SET_SCHEDULE"}
    - Need to figure out both how I want to present this (with entities), AND how I can/will convert those entities
      into cards.  Also might need to use services alongside it.
